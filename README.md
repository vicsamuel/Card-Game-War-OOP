## About
This is the classic card game War, built out with Python using Object Oriented Coding concepts! There are more features to be added, but the base game is finished and ready to play! The rules of the card game are listed here below: 

The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time,
face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down,
in front of him.

The Game:
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card
takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face
down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles
(six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places
another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the
higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.
